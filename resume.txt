EXPERIENCE Senior Data Scientist, SageSure Capital Holdings, Inc. 01/2023 – Present
Post-Hurricane Damage Detection | Computer Vision
• Spearheaded development of a post-hurricane damage detection model using Nearmap aerial imagery and PyTorch, achieving 74% overall accuracy, which accelerated triaging of 30% claims and reduced claims processing time.
• Collaborated with Claims and Catastrophe Response teams to define model success criteria and integrate outputs into adjuster workflows; presented findings in stakeholder reviews to drive adoption across high-risk regions.
LLMs & Document Intelligence | NLP
• Automated structured data extraction from 500K+ insurance declaration PDFs using LLMs (OpenAI API), AWS Lambda, and SQL pipelines; reduced manual workload by 40 hours/week in contractor labor.
• Designed and led implementation of a Slack-based onboarding chatbot using fine-tuned LLaMA-2 and RAG with fuzzy glossary search; decreased onboarding time by 20% across new tech hires.
• Productionized a policy cancellation reason classifier (IBERTA) using BERT, cosine similarity, and gibberish filtering; achieved 81% accuracy and improved minority-class recall by 25%, enabling early churn detection by Customer Success teams.
Leadership & Mentorship
• Provided strategic mentorship to Summer 2024 intern on the post-hurricane damage project, ensuring labeling quality and efficient use of SageMaker Ground Truth for image annotation.
• Regularly collaborated with product, engineering, and claims stakeholders, driving alignment between model outputs and business decision workflows.
Data Science Intern, Bombora 05/2022 - 12/2022
• Improved downstream classifier AUC from 0.82 to 0.87 by redesigning intent topic hierarchy using BERT embeddings and agglomerative clustering, enhancing product precision for B2B client segmentation.
• Collaborated with Product and Engineering teams to integrate improved hierarchy into intent scoring products.
Graduate Research Assistant, Stevens Institute of Technology 01/2022 - 07/2022
• Developed Multimodal Embedding Initialized Bottleneck Sharing (MEIBS), a novel fake news detection model combining deep learning and cross-modal representation learning, outperforming state-of-the-art by 2–3% on Twitter, Weibo, and GossipCop datasets. (Thesis Link)
Hanlon Financial Lab Assistant, Stevens Institute of Technology 10/2021 - 12/2021
• Maintained and secured Hanlon Servers against DoS attacks; conducted research on reinforcement learning techniques.
Research Intern, Stevens Institute of Technology 06/2021 - 09/2021
• Developed an evidence extraction system for factual claim verification using structured/unstructured Wikipedia data; classified claims as Supported, Refuted, or Not Enough Info (NEI).
